How to use:

1. Extend CuteProvider

The MomWidget displays Cute objects, which are just an image, a name, and something said. Initialize these within your own CuteProvider. I have included a demo CuteProvider class.

2. Decide the frequency of each CuteProvider in MomWidgetProvider.

Add instances of CuteProvider to the constructor of MomWidgetProvider. Modify getRandomCute() to decide how frequently each CuteProvider gets used.

notes: Widget only updates every 30 minutes at max (needs heavier modification to change this time). Add your own preview in momwidget_provider.xml. Add your own icon in AndroidManifest.xml
